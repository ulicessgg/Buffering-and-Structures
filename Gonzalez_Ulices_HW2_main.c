* Project:: Assignment 2 â€“ Stucture in Memory and Buffering
*
* File:: Gonzalez_Ulices_HW2_main.c
*
* Description:: This file creates an instance of the personal
* information struct provided in the assignment2.h file and
* allocates the memory for the instance using malloc and then
* proceeds to assign values to each variable in the struct
* after this is completed the following portion of the program
* allocates memory for a character buffer that is then filled
* with string values and then committed once full and repreated
* until no values are left to be comitted, this will then lead
* to the program returning a value to check the success of the
* processes that have been completed and will display a hexdump
* generated over the course of the program being executed
